Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/UCL-BLIC-analysis/Turati_NatCancer_2021/tree/9254340fc7a442989876f2f9cd48f73253274915" target="_blank">9254340</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This document presents the Gene Set Analysis for the bulk RNA-seq data in this project.</p>
<p>The analyisis is performed using fGSEA (Sergushichev A (2016). “An algorithm for fast preranked gene set enrichment analysis using cumulative statistic calculation.” bioRxiv. doi: 10.1101/060012, <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/20/060012" class="uri">http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/20/060012</a>).</p>
<p>We sort the genes by their Wald statistic, as provided by DESeq2.</p>
